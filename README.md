About

Hi — I'm Ruwani Prasadika, a full stack developer passionate about building performant, accessible, and user-centered web applications. I specialize in Next.js and TypeScript for front-end and full-stack React applications, and I use Python and MongoDB for backend services and data storage.

Core Skills

- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django), Node.js (optional)
- Database: MongoDB
- Design & Prototyping: Figma
- Other: Git, REST APIs, Responsive Design, Deployment (Vercel, Netlify)

What I Build

I build modern web applications with server-side rendering, static generation, and client-side interactivity. I focus on:

- Scalable and maintainable code using TypeScript and modern React patterns
- Clean UI and prototypes designed in Figma
- RESTful APIs and data models backed by MongoDB
- Optimized performance and accessibility
